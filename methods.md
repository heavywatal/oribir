Usage
-----

Origami Bird Simulator (OBS) starts from the time an Origami Bird population splits into to two separated populations.
The application window has three tabs.
In the first and second tabs, the user observes the evolution of two populations respectively.
The user can alter the parameters (environment, mutation rate, and population size, observation period) for each tab.
The environment denotes the abundance of oases and can be chosen from three options: rich, medium, and poor.
Figure 3a shows the example where the oasis-poor environment is chosen.
When "Lock" button is pressed, the parameters are locked and the simulation gets ready to start.
Ten individuals that are chosen randomly from the population are displayed on the right side.
The test subject for crossing experiment is selected by clicking the individual in this panel.
The user repeats these steps for in the second tab (Figure 3b shows the example where the user choose the oasis-rich environment).
In the "Crossing Experiment" tab, the selected individuals from the two populations are displayed.
The pair trys to mate when the "Cross" button is pressed.
Children are born if they succeed (Figure 3c) otherwise the animation of copulation failure is displayed (Figure 3d).
